1. A class is what an entity represents, a class arranges information and behavior.

1. Encapsulation combines methods and data within a class and controls the accessibility of the methods and data (controls the use of the class).

1. You initiate an instance of a class by specifying the class as 'new' where you will have to redefine the variables, however you can define the variables by previous instances of the class.

1. The access is only within the class. You can change the default by using the public and private keywords (private = only within the class), (public = both within and outside the class)

1. new 'Constructor' and then add a public method that not return a value and give it the same name as the class. Constructor has to have the same name as the class. 

1. Instance field/method means every object has one of them. Object fields and methods are members of the class. 

1. Static using statements enable you to bring a class into scope and omit the class name when accessing static members. You would do this to use classes over without having to create the class each time.

1. You would use an anonymous class when you want to use multiple variables. 

1. Ability to present the same interface for differing underlying forms

1. Message passing relies on the process and its supporting organization to call the actual code to run. 

1. LISP was the first language capable of OOP, but the first designed for OOP was Smalltalk.
