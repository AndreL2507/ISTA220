### C# Ch.8 Homework
---
1. Deep copies have you make a clone each time you create a new object, whereas a shallow clone will clone the object once and after that will copy references. 

1. A memory address.

1. You add a public static method called value where you pass it a value parameter with a type

1. Declare the reference method and assign it another parameter.

1. Yes

1. No, because the method expects an ordinary type.

1. The stack contains values and the heap contains references to those values.

1. All classes have types

1. ref references the original argument. Anything you do to the parameter you must also do to the original argument. 

1. Out initializes the parameter from the method itself.

1. After the initializing of an object the memory is copied over to the memory of the heap (boxing), the heap gets the boxed object that matches and then casts it back to the stack 

1. Changing value types so that the method may succeed.
